/* Not 100% sure what this is but:
 *  - it's on port 53 but is definitely not DNS
 *  - involves servers owned by 360.cn, who 'supposedly' are antivirus experts
 *  - most of these same servers are contacted by various known malware, 
      particularly Zegost variants
 *  - the protocol appears to be a custom encryption protocol
 *
 * In all likelihood, this is the C&C protocol for some nasty Chinese backdoor.
